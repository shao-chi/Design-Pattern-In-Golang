# Strategy Pattern

*“In computer programming, the strategy pattern (also known as the policy pattern) is a software design pattern that enables an algorithm’s behavior to be selected at runtime. The strategy pattern*

* *defines a family of algorithms,*
* *encapsulates each algorithm, and*
* *makes the algorithms interchangeable within that family.”*

### composition
* 將 behavior 抽出來
* 讓 context 可以動態替換 behavior
* 切開業務邏輯與演算法的實現
